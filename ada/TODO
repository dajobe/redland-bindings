* Stopped at http://librdf.org/docs/api/redland-concepts.html

* Add functions Copy to explicitly copy a _Without_Finalize object.
  Copy shall have controlling result.
  Using controlling result we can define Copy in Handed_Record package?

* Unify function names: New_* vs Create.

* "TODO" in the sources.

* Add "pragma Pure()" where appropriate.

* Can Adjust be done without Set_Handle_Hack, using class-wide types?

* Add "with Inline" whereever feasible.

* Add "limited" to records where appropriate.

* Some raptor_parser_*() and librdf_storage_() functions return <0 on missing
  required base URI. Should we raise a different exception in this case?

* Add strings to exception raised.

* Should Base_Stream be an interface rather than a tagged type?

* Check sources with AdaControl and gnatcheck.
