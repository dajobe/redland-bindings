* Move Redland syntax description info into a separate package?

* Add functions Copy to explicitly copy a _Without_Finalize object.
  Copy shall have controlling result?

* "TODO" in the sources.

* Add "limited" to records where appropriate.

* Some raptor_parser_*() and librdf_storage_() functions return <0 on missing
  required base URI. Should we raise a different exception in this case?
  Also librdf_parser_set_feature().

* Add strings to exception raised.

* Should Base_Stream be an interface rather than a tagged type?

* Check sources with AdaControl and gnatcheck.
