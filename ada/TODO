* Consider replacing controlling argument types with class-wide types.

* Add "pragma Pure()" where appropriate.

* {Get,Set}_Feature for RDF.Redland.Serializer are not implemented due
  http://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=641

* Add "limited" to records where appropriate.

* Should Base_Stream be an interface rather than a tagged type?

* Check sources with AdaControl and gnatcheck.

* Add strings to exception raised.

* Some raptor_parser_*() and librdf_storage_() functions return <0 on missing
  required base URI. Should we raise a different exception in this case?
  Also librdf_parser_set_feature().

* https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82639
  Because of this GNAT compliler bug, some records which should be private
  are not.
  See rdf-raptor-term.ads

* Consider if we can remove World argument in RDF.Rasqal.Bnode.Do_handle
  and make the API the same as in RDF.Raptor.Bnode, possibly merging both
  tagged types.

* rasqal_new_query_results2() is not supported as of Rasqal 0.9.32
  installed on my system.

* More testing.
