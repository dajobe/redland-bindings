* Stopped at http://librdf.org/rasqal/docs/api/rasqal-section-service.html

* "TODO" in the sources.

* Can Adjust be done without Set_Handle_Hack, using class-wide types?

* Add "with Inline" whereever feasible.

* Add "limited" to records where appropriate.

* Check that we use T'Class rather then T where appropriate.

* Some raptor_parser_*() functions return <0 on missing required base URI.
  Should we raise a different exception in this case?

* Add strings to exception raised.

* It seems that I sometimes use New_String where To_C for char_array does better.

* Subprograms which modify an object should have "in out" mode.

* Should Base_Stream be an interface rather than a tagged type?

* To_C: "If Append_Nul is False and Item'Length is 0, then To_C propagates Constraint_Error."
  Check for such error cases.
