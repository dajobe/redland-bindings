This are thick object orienteed Ada2012 bindings for Redland
Raptor library.

Backward incompatible API changes are possible at this stage.

These are Raptor RDF Syntax Library and Rasqal RDF Query Library bindings
ONLY, no support for Redland RDF Libraries. (You are welcome to work on
supplements to this library, but this is not a priority for myself.)

Some parts of RDF Syntax Library are not supported (I mean, not bound to
Ada):

* AVL Trees (internals)
* SAX2 (use XMLAda instead)
* Sequence (internals)
* String buffer (use Ada code instead)
* Unicode (use an Ada library)
* XML QName (internals)
* XML (use XMLAda instead)
* Rasqal expressions (internals)
* Rasqal graph patterns (internals)
* Rasqal literals (internals)
* Rasqal prefixes (internals)
* Rasqal triples (internals)
* Rasqal triple sources (internals)
* Rasqal variables (internals)
* Rasqal variable tables (internals)
* Rasqal updates (internals)
* Rasqal utilities (internals)
* XSD related objects (not a priority to implement)
* Query Results Formatter
* Query Result Row (C API is too rudimentary)
* Service (requires Sequences which are not yet implemented)
* Redland Digests (internals)
* Redland Files (internals)
* Redland Hashes (internals)
* Redland Heuristics (internals)
* Redland Iterator (internals) # FIXME: Should be bound
* Redland List (internals)

The following APIs are implemented partially:

* Rasqal Query
* Literals (not implemented things related to patterns)

It may be downgraded to Ada2005 but this isn't a priority for me.

Implementation note:
It seems we can simplify away using Ada.Unchecked_Conversion for enumeration
types. Instead just make record field and function arguments of Ada
enumeration types. Right?

See "TODO" and "FIXME" in the source about possible improvement of the Ada
library.

Documentation of the Ada bindings are not written yet. One reason for this
is that adabrowse package does not work with my installation of Debian
Linux.

There are some unit tests (using AUnit library), but they do not cover
all code. I would not recommend to use this library for software which
should be highly reliable.
