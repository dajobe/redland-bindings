NF-33-IC16-035 Add timing of individual tests (2010-01-08)

  Users can select for timing of individual tests as well as cumulative time.
  This is specified in AUnit.Options.

NF-33-IA08-009 General AUnit improvements (2009-10-09)

  Some new functionalities have been implemented in AUnit:
  * The Text reporter now allows colored output on ANSI terminals.
  * Unexpected exceptions are now reported with their message and symbolic
    traceback when available.
  * It is now possible to run a subset of the tests
    This requires initializing and passing a Test_Filter object
  * Test_Result is now extensible by the user
    In particular, this means you can do postprocessing after each test has
    been run, like synchronous output for instance.
