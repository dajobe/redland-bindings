KP-31-I814-014 AUnit fails to install for LynxOS

  Problem:    The pthread run-time library was not included as an option in
              the AUnit shared project file template.

  Status:     This was fixed in 3.2 on 2009-08-14

  Workaround: Manual build of AUnit from sources

KP-31-I803-020 Installation failure on Solaris

  Problem:    On Solaris, 'make install' fails to install AUnit. This is due
              to 'sed' not being able to work on files not terminated by a
              trailing LF character.

  Status:     This was fixed in 3.2 on 2009-08-04

  Workaround: Use GNU sed for Solaris and retry installing.
