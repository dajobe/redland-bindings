KP-34-L306-042 Installer issues on Windows

  Problem:    It happens on rare occasions that the Windows installer cannot
              find any compiler on your system, even if the PATH environment
              variable is correctly set and gprbuild is present.

  Status:     This was fixed in 3.5 on 2012-03-12

  Workaround: Use the source package and install AUnit using the Makefile.

KP-34-L326-023 Incorrect XML generated

  Problem:    The XML output is incorrect

  Status:     This was fixed in 3.5 on 2012-03-27

  Workaround: Use the text output, or rebuild AUnit with aunit-reporter-xml.adb
              from a more recent release.
