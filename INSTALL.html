<h1>Redland RDF Application Framework Bindings - Building and Installing from Source</h1>


<h2>1. Get pre-requisites</h2>

<p>The Redland Bindings require a previously built and installed
Redland package with the same version number.  In particular, the
header files, shared libraries and SWIG interface files that Redland
provides are required for most language bindings.  An alternative to
installation is to extract the Redland sources in a parent directory
or a sibling directory called 'librdf'.</p>


<h2>2. Getting the sources</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get the sources.  The most stable and
tested versions are the sources shipped with each release and these
are recommended as the first place to start.  For the latest
developent sources, anonymous Subversion access is available but this may
require some configuring of developer tools that are not needed for
the snapshot releases.</p>

<p>The source bundle and package files contain all the HTML files and
documentation provided on the web site.</p>


<h3>2.1. Getting the sources from releases</h3>

<p>The released sources and available from
<a href="http://download.librdf.org/source/">http://download.librdf.org/source/</a> master site as well as the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/">SourceForge site</a>.
</p>


<h3>2.2. Getting the sources from Subversion</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Redland Bindings switched to use
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
for version control after the 1.0.3.1 release.  If you were
using CVS, you will need to re-check out the sources.</p>

<pre>
  svn checkout http://svn.librdf.org/repository/bindings/trunk/
  mv trunk bindings
  cd bindings
</pre>

<p>At this stage, or after a <code>svn update</code> you will
need to create the automake and autoconf derived files, as described
below in <a href="#sec-create-configure">Create the configure program</a>
by using the <code>autogen.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Building the Redland bindings in this way requires some particular
development tools not needed when building from snapshot releases -
automake, autoconf and swig.
The <code>autogen.sh</code> script looks for the newest versions
of the auto* tools and checks that they meet the minimum versions.</p>



<h2>3. Configuring and building</h2>

<p>Redland bindings uses the GNU automake and autoconf to handle
system dependency checking.  <code>configure</code> tries very hard
to find several programs and libraries that the Redland bindings
need.  These include the binding binaries: perl, python, etc.,
headers for the bindings such as the JDK, Python etc.  and various
others.  A summary of the parts found is given at the end of the
configure run.  Several options to configure given below can be used
to point to locations or names of dependencies that cannot be
automatically determined.</p>

<p>Redland Bindings is developed and built on x86 GNU/Linux
(Redhat Fedora Core 4, Debian unstable) but is also regularly tested on
sparc Sun Solaris, x86 FreeBSD, ppc Apple OSX 
and as part of Redland on several other systems via the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> compile farm
(typically AMD64, Alpha, Solaris x86, OpenBSD, NetBSD).</p>


<h3><a id="sec-create-configure" name="sec-create-configure"></a>3.1. Create <code>configure</code> program</h3>

<p>If there is no <code>configure</code> program, you can create it 
by running the <code>autogen.sh</code> script, as long as you have the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
tools.  This is done by:</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>and you can also pass along arguments intended for configure (see
below for what these are):</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/somewhere
</pre>

<p>Alternatively you can run the automake and autoconf programs by
hand with:</p>
<pre>
  aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
</pre>

<p>The automake and autoconf tools have many different versions and
at present development is being done with automake 1.8.3 (minimum
version 1.7), autoconf 2.59 (minimum version 2.54) and libtool 1.5.4
(minimum version 1.4).  These are only needed when compiling from Subversion
sources.  autogen.sh enforces the requirements.  In future
development will move to require automake 1.8, autoconf 2.58 and
libtool 1.5.</p>


<h3>3.2. Options for <code>configure</code></h3>

<p>See also the generic GNU installation instructions in 
<a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> for information about general options
such as <code>--prefix</code> etc.</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>--with-perl</code>(=<em>PERL-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-php</code>(=<em>PHP-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-python</code>(=<em>PYTHON-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-ruby</code>(=<em>RUBY-COMMAND</em>)<br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the given language APIs - the default is to build
no language APIs automatically.  If the option value is omitted or
<em>yes</em>, configure will guess the location of the language
command.  If the option value is <em>no</em> or no option is given,
the language API will be disabled - this is the default, not
to build any language API.</p>

<p>If the option is given a value, that is used as the appropriate
language command to use.  For example <code>--with-ruby=ruby1.8</code>
will use the 'ruby1.8' binary, whereas <code>--with-ruby</code> will use
'ruby' as the binary, both of these will be searched for in the PATH.
An absolute path could alternatively be given such as
<code>--with-python=/opt/mypython/bin/python</code> 
to use a python installation in a different location.</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-python-ldflags</code>(=<em>FLAGS</em>)<br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the linker flags for linking Python.  This can also be
done by setting the environment variable <code>PYTHON_LDFLAGS</code>.
If neither is set, <code>configure</code> will guess an appropriate
set for the current system.  Cygwin example:</p>
<pre>
  -with-python-ldflags='-shared -L/usr/lib/python2.5/config -lpython2.5'
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><code>--with-python-libext</code>=<em>.EXT</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the python shared library link extension (default <code>.so</code>).
Useful on systems where .so does not work as a shared library extension.
Cygwin example:</p>
<pre>
  -with-python-libext=.dll
</pre>
</dd>

<dt><code>--with-redland=</code> <code>system</code> or <code>internal</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>
This option tells the bindings to use either the system installed version
of <a href="http://librdf.org/">redland</a>
or an internal version, in a parent or sibling directory as
described above.  If the option is omittted, the system one is
prefered, and if none is available, configure will stop.
</p></dd>

</dl>


<h3>3.3 Configuring</h3>

<p>If everything is in the default place, do:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure
</pre>

<p>More commonly you will be doing something like this, indicating
which binding or bindings are wanted:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --with-python
</pre>

<p>If you are having problems with configuring several times when
adding or removing options, you may have to tidy up first with either
of these:</p>
<pre>
   make clean
   rm -f config.cache
</pre>

<h3>3.4 Compiling</h3>

<pre>
   make
</pre>


<h2 id="sec-testing">3.5. Testing</h2>

<p>You can build and run the built-in tests for Redland with:</p>
<pre>
    make check
</pre>
<p>which will run these tests for the enabled languages.  These
<em>may fail</em> if the main redland libraries (librdf and
raptor, rasqal) are not installed but are used in nearby source trees.
So in this case you should install redland, raptor and rasqal first</p>

<p>The language-specific tests can also be built and run with:</p>
<pre>
   cd language
   make check
</pre>



<h3 id="sec-install">3.6 Installing the bindings</h3>

<p>To install the bindings, do:</p>

<pre>
   make install
</pre>

<p>Otherwise, the language-specific installations can be made with:</p>
<pre>
  cd language
  make install
</pre>



<h2>4. Using the library</h2>

<p>There are many examples for all of the language interfaces in the
corresponding sub-directories such as <code>perl/example.pl</code>
which may be easier to modify.</p>



<h2>5. Using the Perl interface</h2>

<p>See the <a href="docs/perl.html">Redland Perl Interface</a> document for
full information on installing and using Redland from Perl.</p>

<h2>6. Using the Python interface</h2>

<p>See the <a href="docs/python.html">Redland Python Interface</a> document for
full information on installing and using Redland from Python.</p>

<h2>7. Using the Ruby interface</h2>

<p>See the <a href="docs/ruby.html">Redland Ruby Interface</a> document for
full information on installing and using Redland from Ruby.</p>

<h2>8. Using the PHP interface</h2>

<p>See the <a href="docs/php.html">Redland PHP Interface</a> document for
full information on installing and using Redland from PHP.</p>
